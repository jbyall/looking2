            <h3>Richard Neidinger</h3>
            <h4>Executive Officer</h4>
            <p>
                An attorney by training, Rick developed the idea behind Looking2 a decade ago out of frustration with the constraints of advertising.  
                It is, of course, a necessary evil, but so much money spent on it is literally thrown away.  Who saves the ad they see in print, 
                or remembers the one they heard or saw?  The signs you pass as you drive along, or those that pass you, carefully painted on trucks, 
                are of little use when it comes time to actually find them.  So he set about developing a database that would capture all of those 
                carefully-chosen buzz words so that people could actually find them.  He is based in Pittsburgh, PA.
