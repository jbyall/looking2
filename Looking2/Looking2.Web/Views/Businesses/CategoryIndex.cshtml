                We don't exactly pigeonhole Listings (and will let you make as many as you need within reason to cover what you are offering),
                but because Looking2 is a one-stop directory intended for almost anything, we encourage Listers to pick a general Category for each Listing so that
                Lookers can limit their searches to what they are actually looking to find.
